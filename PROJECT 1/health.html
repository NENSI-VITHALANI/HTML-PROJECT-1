	  <em>
	  A number of Norwegian companies have made a difference in the lives of patients all over the world.<br>

Tremendous strides have been made in the fields of medicine and pharmaceuticals during the past century.<br>

These are the result of large and small advances made at laboratories, universities and hospitals around the globe. Below is a look at four Norwegian companies that have made vital contributions to medical science and who are poised to continue their ground-breaking work.<br>

    <h2>Fighting cancer that has spread to the bones</h2>	
	<br>
	Some types of cancer are more difficult to treat than others. When cancer has spread to the bones, for example, there are few alternatives. Available treatments have major side-effects and are of varying efficacy. Fortunately, a Norwegian company has found a way to slow bone metastases.
    <br>
	Building on research conducted at Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Algeta has developed a cancer drug based on radium-223, a radioactive isotope. While radium treatment of cancer was widespread in the past, it has more or less been replaced by alternatives with fewer side-effects. Algetaâ€™s breakthrough is a targeted drug that is highly precise and has a short half-life, thereby minimising side-effects. The drug was launched under the name Alpharadin, and is now called Xofigo.
